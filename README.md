# AI Recruiter — India Runs Hackathon 2026

> **Track 1: Data & AI Challenge** — Candidate Ranking System  
> **Track 2, Challenge 1: AI Systems Architect** — Multi-Agent Recruiter Swarm  
> Building what next India runs on.

An autonomous multi-agent AI system that revolutionizes talent acquisition. Instead of traditional keyword-based filtering, this system uses a coordinated **swarm of specialized AI agents** that deeply understand job descriptions, semantically rank candidates, conduct voice-based screenings, and autonomously manage the entire hiring pipeline — from sourcing to shortlisting.

---

## 🧠 The Big Idea

Recruiters drown in profiles. Keyword filters miss hidden gems. Good candidates fall through the cracks.

The **AI Recruiter Agent Swarm** replaces linear, keyword-based filtering with an intelligent, autonomous system of coordinated AI agents — each specialized in one phase of recruitment — working together to find the perfect candidate for every role.

## 🤖 Agents Defined

| Agent | Role | Capabilities |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Brain of the system | Routes tasks, maintains conversation state, decides when to escalate to humans |
| **Sourcer Agent** | Profile discovery | Crawls job portals, GitHub, LinkedIn, internal DBs. Learns new sources over time |
| **Matcher Agent** | Semantic ranking | Embeds JDs + profiles, computes relevance scores beyond keyword match. Detects transferable skills |
| **Screener Agent** | Voice-based pre-interview | Conducts natural voice interviews in Hinglish/regional languages. Assesses communication, cultural fit, and technical basics |
| **Scheduler Agent** | Logistics coordinator | Syncs calendars, sends reminders, handles rescheduling. Negotiates time slots autonomously |

---

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

| Feature | Traditional ATS | This System |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Matching | Keyword-based | Semantic + behavioral signal analysis |
| Screening | Manual phone screen | AI-driven voice conversation in Hinglish/regional languages |
| Sourcing | One database | Autonomous multi-source crawling |
| Coordination | Manual handoffs | Agent-to-agent orchestration |
| Language | English only | English + Hinglish + regional languages |
| Learning | Static rules | Continuous improvement from feedback |
